# Resume in LaTeX

This repository contains my resume written in LaTeX. The PDF output of the resume is also included for convenience.

## Files

- `resume.tex`: The main LaTeX source file for the resume.
- `resume.pdf`: The compiled PDF version of the resume.

## Usage

To compile the LaTeX source file into a PDF, you can use the following command:

```sh
pdflatex resume.tex
```

Feel free to explore and modify the LaTeX source to suit your needs.
